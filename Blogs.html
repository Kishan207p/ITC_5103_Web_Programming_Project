      <h3>Top Travel Bloggers</h3>
      <p>
        Nowadays it is impossible to understand the world of travel & tourism
        without the opinion of bloggers; what they say on Facebook, twitter and
        other social networks matters. Thanks to the access to our social media
        accounts through the smartphones it has taken an even greater role.
        Blogging is a trend that will do nothing but grow at the expense of the
        magazines; especially specialist media will be in the background.
        Today's traveller looks for experiences through travel blogs, which have
        become a source of inspiration for destination search and vacation
        planning.

            avid adventurer who's been there and done that all. Yes, this woman
            quit her corporate job and started following her heart in 2011, when
            she was just 23 years old. Today, a few years down the lane, she is
            as happy as a free bird, discovering new places and sharing her
            experiences on her award-winning blog. If you have a thing for solo
            traveling, you must not miss Shivya Nath's writings. Her take on
            solo travels and discovering lesser-known destinations are a hit
            with readers.
