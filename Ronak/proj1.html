            <p>Souvenir shopping is serious business. One can be a light traveller with just a backpack or someone who travels with an additional empty suitcase, but no matter, local souvenirs will catch your eye and you&rsquo;d want to take a small token of your travels back home with you. They act as reminders on a day when you really wished you were on the road. At least, that&rsquo;s what I feel. For a vast, diverse country like India, it is so tough to decide what to take back home when visiting. Obviously travelling through the length and breadth of the country on just one holiday isn&rsquo;t possible but no matter which part you choose, you will always come across different local souvenirs to take back. Among the 29 states, India has a host of GI-tagged souvenirs which one can take back.</p>
